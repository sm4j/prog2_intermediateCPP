# Programming 2 Course Assignments Repository

This repository houses all my assignments from my Programming 2 course, completed in Spring 2024. While it serves as a comprehensive showcase of my programming skills and commitment to organization, there is no version history because all assignments were submitted during that semester, and the repository was created solely for showcasing coursework without ongoing updates.

## Key Takeaways

- **Modular Programming:** Developed programs that utilize function prototypes for better organization and readability.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implemented input validation across all assignments to ensure user inputs are accurate and manageable.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Applied encapsulation and inheritance principles effectively, particularly in the Student Grade Tracker.
- **Memory Management:** Demonstrated expertise in dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in the Dynamic String Manager.
- **Operator Overloading:** Enhanced user experience in the Rational Number Calculator through intuitive operator overloading.
- **File I/O Capabilities:** Enabled data persistence through efficient reading from and writing to files in the Quiz Score Generator.
- **Practical Applications:** Created tools like the Loan Amortization Calculator and Quiz Score Generator, illustrating real-world programming solutions.

## Assignment Summaries

### Program 0: Hello World
A basic, slightly interactive "Hello World" program, included for repository completeness.

### Program 1: Smart Coin Dispenser
This program highlights key programming concepts by utilizing function prototypes for modular organization. It ensures user input validation within a specified range and effectively handles errors with conditionals. The conversion of double to int for currency representation emphasizes typecasting and rounding for accuracy. Using constants for coin values enhances code readability, while mathematical operations and standard library functions demonstrate practical applications in a user-friendly console program.

### Program 2: Loan Amortization Calculator
The "Loan Amortization Calculator" is a well-crafted C++ program that calculates loan details and generates amortization schedules based on user inputs. Its clean and organized driver code features functions that serve a single purpose, enhancing readability and maintainability. The program includes meaningful function names and clear comments, demonstrating effective error handling through input validation. The use of pointers for data management showcases strong memory management skills, while formatted output ensures clear communication with users.

### Program 3: Quiz Score Generator
The "Quiz Score Generator" is an efficient C++ program designed to randomly generate quiz scores for a specified number of students, calculating and storing their average scores. The well-structured code utilizes a Student struct to organize data, separating input handling, score generation, and output formatting. User prompts guide the input process, while error handling ensures valid data entry. The program reads from an input file and appends each student's average score to their quiz results, exemplifying good programming practices.

### Program 4: Student Grade Tracker
This program effectively utilizes encapsulation through base and derived classes to manage student information for a course. The base class, COP3014, handles essential data such as names, Z-numbers, assignments, midterm, and final grades, providing a comprehensive set of member functions for input, display, and calculations. The derived class, Spring24, extends this functionality by adding a lab grade, with its own methods for input and grade computation. Rigorous input validation ensures all grades fall within acceptable ranges, demonstrating solid object-oriented design principles.

### Program 5: Rational Number Calculator
This program showcases a robust implementation of a Rational class in C++. It includes a driver file (main.cpp), a class implementation file (rationalJS.cpp), and a header file (rationalJS.h). The program allows for the creation of rational numbers, arithmetic operations, comparisons, and simplifications. It employs operator overloading for intuitive interactions, ensuring user-friendly input and output. Extensive testing in the driver validates the functionality of its member functions and operator overloads, exemplifying good software engineering practices.

### Program 6: Dynamic String Manager
The provided C++ code illustrates essential concepts in class design, including constructor overloading and the implementation of a copy constructor, emphasizing memory management. It effectively utilizes dynamic memory with new and delete, highlighting the importance of proper allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks. Operator overloading for ==, +, <<, and >> enables intuitive syntax for comparisons, concatenation, and input/output operations. The code also demonstrates string manipulation techniques through methods for substring extraction and character access, with built-in bounds checking for safety. Finally, the destructor ensures resource cleanup, reinforcing best practices in resource management.
